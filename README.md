## Notes
1. When uploading documents to the profile page you need to upload a PDF document.
2. If you are a recruiter, you can change job seekersâ€™ submittal status by going to "Company List -> Show -> Jobs -> Applications -> edit". Then you can change submittal status for those seekers who have applied to jobs which you, recruiter, has posted.
3. If a job seeker haven't uploaded his/her document yet, the "Document" field of a profile will show a small question mark image.
4. Whenever you create a company, an application, or an user. If you are unable to create it without completing all the fields on the form, try to leave something like 'N/A' in cells that you don't want to fill in.
