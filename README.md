## Notes
1. When uploading documents to a profile page you need to upload a PDF-format document.

2. If you are a recruiter, you can change job seekersâ€™ submittal status by going to "Companies & Jobs  -> Details, Jobs, and Applications -> Jobs -> Applications -> Change Status". REMEMBER! You can ONLY change submittal status of applicaitons for the jobs you posted!!!

3. If a job seeker hasn't uploaded his/her document yet, the "Document" field of a profile will show a small question mark image.

4. Whenever you create a company, an application, or an user. If you are unable to create it without completing all the fields on the form, try to leave something like 'N/A' in cells that you don't want to fill in. 

5. To use the same email address for both a recruiter and a job seeker, simply log-in with your email address and choose your role on the Profile page. It will then default to logging you in as the same role until you switch it on that page. 

6. To see your own applications (if you are a job seeker), please go to 'User List' and click on the 'Applicaitons' button behind your account.

7. To simplify the job search functionality we made the search button check all important fields of the company (name, industry, size, or headquarters).
